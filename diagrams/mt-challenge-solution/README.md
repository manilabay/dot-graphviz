# MT Architecture Deliverables Artefacts

MT put a challenge Case Study for Raul Andres, this document is the artefacts delivered to MT. Raul Andres create a new project dot-graphviz-aws repo to generate architecture diagrams on fly and reuse it to work in any architecture task as a base to governance and maintain Business and Technology Architecture workflow.

MT represent a real company, but author masked it due interview confidential materials and process.
The Case Study isn't deployed for same reasons.

# Envelop project: dot-graphviz-aws

the envelop project is:

## High level risks

MT note: High level risks that you see in such a program


## Architecture views

MT note: Any other architecture views that you perceive as being relevant
