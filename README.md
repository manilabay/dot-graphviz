# dot-graphviz-aws
This project is another PoC by Raul Andres to create an amazing idea to generate Architecture diagrams using dot language + graphviz + aws icons + git . Lets start to create and modify Architecture diagrams in agile way! ;)

This idea Raul Andres thought 2 years ago to agilize the Architecture workflow and now it is the time to create the solution and put in practice.

The goals is to personally reuse this technic to be more efficient and agile in the next Architecture jobs he will do.

It uses AWS icons but it could be used with any icons library creating another xxx-icons folder.

Please feel free to reuse and hack it, enjoy!

## MT Challenge example
Raul Andres was challenged by MT company(masking the company name, but it is a real company) to do a Case-Study for an interview process and he decided to create the diagrams with code and later reuse his effort to build the next diagrams.

## Example Diagrams generated

The architecture artefacts generated is in the folder [mt-challenge-solution](https://github.com/manilabay/dot-graphviz-aws/diagrams/mt-challenge-solution)

### MT-logical-architecture  

![MT-logical-architecture](diagrams/mt-challenge-solution/mt-logical-architecture.png?raw=true "MT-logical-architecture")

## How to use

0. Learn dot language and graphviz. To see some References below.
1. Create a new folder inside diagrams folder
2. Create new README.md inside that new folder, using [this] https://github/manilabay/dot-graphviz-aws/diagrams/mt-challenge-solution/README.md as a template.
3. Create dot code for the diagram you want create using language-dot syntax
4. Show and share the diagrams and knowledge with your Architect mates.
5. Get some reward, a coffee, a beer or why not a increase salary ;)
